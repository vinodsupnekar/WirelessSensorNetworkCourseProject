1. How to install program into your motes?
Basically, you need to install 3 program into your motes.
1.1 Install emitter program: 
	Under the directory of emitter, run " make install.5 telosb /dev/ttyUSB# " ( # is the USB sequence number you are using) 
1.2 Install forwarder program:
	Under the directory of forwarder, run " make install.X telosb /dev/ttyUSB# " ( X is 1, 2 or 3, # is the USB seq No.)
1.3 Install base station program:
	Under the directory of base, run " make install.0 telosb /dev/ttyUSB# " ( # is the USB seq No.)

2. If you want to test this NesC program you have two choices
2.1 java TestSerial -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb
Result should look like follow
Mote ID 1, RSSI 20
Mote ID 2, RSSI 18
Mote ID 3, RSSI 19
	.
	.
	.
2.2 java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:telosb
Result should look like follow
last 9 digit
nodeid -- counter -- -- -- rssi timestamp --
01     03  DA     00 06 00  16    1F      E4
01     03  DA     00 06 00  16    21      2F
03     03  DA     00 15 00  12    B3      FA

3. There are UI program press.java and basic operation program TestSerial.java
Run "make telosb" first and run "javac press.java" then to get a press.class file, and then run "java press", then you can get a UI to run and stop the program.
FYI: 
a. monitor function only works when you have a cheese program in your PC. Sorry for that.
b. I quote some of my code in TestSerial.java for testing and for your convenience to test. I mention that in my code.
